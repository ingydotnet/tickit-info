# Current Curses::UI Widgets

This document has pictures and thoughts of all the current Curses::UI
widgets.

Curses::UI is difficult to use because its box model is fairly
broken. However it has a decent set of widgets to build things with.
These widgits (and more) should be represented in Tickit.
