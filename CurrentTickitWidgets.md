# Current Tickit Widgets

This document has pictures and thoughts of all the current Tickit.pm
widgets.

| Name                   | Source |
|------------------------|--------|
| Tickit::Widget::Box    | Tickit |
| Tickit::Widget::HBox   | Tickit |
| Tickit::Widget::Static | Tickit |
| Tickit::Widget::VBox   | Tickit |

Tickit.pm seems to be the best candidate for the future of
interactive terminal apps, but currently lacks the basic widgets to
build serious apps.
